I'm a Linux enthusiast and currently 3<sup>rd</sup> year student of St. Petersburg State University of Economics. Since high school I have been developing various things. I tried myself in variant fields such as Web Development, Mobile Development, Game Development, Software Development and many others. I can work with different office packages, I know Python, C, Bash and other languages. I am interested in the development of projects with algorithmic overtones. I am also interested in low-level things. Knowledge in Linear algebra, Probability and Statistics, Numerical Methods, Optimization Methods, Algorithms and Data structures, Discrete Mathematics. I understand IPv4, IPv6 network protocols and some others.
